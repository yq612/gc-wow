1. Verify Loan Company Information: Before applying for any loan, make sure to verify the legitimacy and background of the loan platform. PesoGo is a legally registered platform, certified by the relevant regulatory bodies in the Philippines, so you can trust our services.
2. Be Cautious of Too-Good-to-Be-True Loan Terms: If loan conditions appear too good to be true, or if approval is granted without any review, this could be a scam. A legitimate loan platform will perform a credit check before approval.
3. Protect Your Personal Information: Avoid sharing sensitive personal information such as your bank account, ID number, or password with anyone. PesoGo only verifies identity through secure methods and will never ask you for sensitive information.
4. Be Aware of Phone and SMS Scams: If you receive a phone call or text message claiming to be from a loan platform and asking for personal information or pre-payment, be cautious. PesoGo never asks clients to pay any fees during the loan application process.`,
